# üéµ Spotify Music Streaming Platform ‚Äì DBMS Project

## üìò Project Overview
This project is a simulation of a music streaming service similar to **Spotify**, built as part of a **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course. It involves designing and implementing a **relational database** that supports a wide range of features such as user activity tracking, artist management, playlist creation, and analytics. A **JavaFX frontend** is integrated for demonstration.

```sql
-- Most liked songs
SELECT TOP 10 title FROM Songs ORDER BY likes_count DESC;

-- User‚Äôs recent streams
SELECT * FROM RecentlyPlayed WHERE user_id = 1 ORDER BY played_at DESC;
